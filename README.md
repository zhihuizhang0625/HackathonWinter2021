💡General Idea:

  People often post “themed” photos on social media. They’ll update their Facebook profile picture with an “I Voted” sticker during election week or with a frame representing their club during club recruitment season. However, there aren’t any tools to easily create such photos with a Penn theme. So we created an app that allows people to add Penn stickers, blue/red filters, or Penn frames to their photos. 

  To use this tool, users need to upload a jpg or png to the app, choose what type of edits they’d like to make to their photo, and then download the edited photo from the app. We hope “Penn Snap” gives students a way to express their school pride and creates a strong sense of community amongst MCIT students. 



📋Anticipated Stack: 
    We used “React” to design the app. 
      📱Front end: 
        We mainly rely on javascript and css to beautify the website design and use online libraries to create better-looking features like buttons
      📱Back end:
        Javascript’s “JIMP” library powered the image editing done on the backend of our app
      📱Deploy
        We use an app called “netlify” to publicize our web app


👩🏻‍💻How to run the code:
      1️⃣Need to download React App and Node.js
      2️⃣In the terminal, run ‘npm install’ if it’s the first time using this program
      3️⃣And then type ‘npm start’ to run the entire program and initiate the website on your selected browser

NOTES: Our original project is in another github repo. But things got too messy so we moved to this new repository.
